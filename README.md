**Note that this documentation as well as the API it describes are subject to
change.**

Using this Documentation
------------------------

### Endpoints ###

The endpoints currently exposed in the API are available under the
[`rest/api/user/v1`](./rest/api/user/v1) path. Directories map to endpoints,
and files map to methods.

For example, [`rest/api/user/v1/{envId}/events/GET.mkd`](./rest/api/user/v1/{envId}/events/GET.mkd)
is documentation for the `GET` method on the `/api/user/v1/{envId}/events/`
endpoint.

### Definitions ###

The [`definitions`](./definitions) folder includes documentation for the
objects that are manipulated using the Scalr API.
